              I am grateful to have lived and studied in France, which allowed me to explore my needs and desires as I went through my journey to obtaining an Engineering Degree in Embedded Systems.
              <br />
              <br />
              Here is how it went:

                      <br />
                      In this rare school system up until 15, I was lucky enough to have half my classes in English, my mother-tongue. This allowed me to grow up fully bilingual in French and English

                      Technical school which brought me to the age of 18 and started my specialisation in all things software and hardware. Thankfully I studied lots of mechanical and physcial concepts as well which broadened my scope of understanding

                      <br />
                      My first two years of University Studies were a balance between concrete skills and theoretical knowledge of electronics and programming, paving the way to a choice of going into the working world with this two-year degree or pursuing further into Engineering

                      <br />
                      Upon deciding to go further, I went to the end of the world (Brest) and embarked in a 3 year trip through the world of Embedded Systems Engineering. Luckily, I had the opportunity to do this as an employed apprentice engineer for half the time, directly applying what I was learning.
